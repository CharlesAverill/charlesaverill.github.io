Challenge Description:

I have recently come across some odd files with a wealth of odd data. but am having trouble making any kind of sense of it, The portion of each entry before "T+" would seem to almost loop after a while, and the portion after "T+" seemed to slowly increase from 00, itâ€™s a two digit integer, maxxing out at 95...

I have a hunch, out of the thousands of data points though, The following two data points did seem to have some sort of significance though

Provide the date the data was collected alongside the appropriate T+ value for Data Point 2 rounded to the nearest 5 minutes

Data point 1: 403721498477T+00m
Data point 2: 403752498505T+??m

Flag format: YYYY/MM/DD-T+(Two digits to represent the minutes rounded to the nearest 5 minutes)m
