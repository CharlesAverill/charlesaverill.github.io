True Poet

Flavor Text: Two things you should know about me: 1. I love libraries 2. I love poems. Combine those two (as well as mischievous friends and some opinions about tables) and BAM! You have me entering a Haiku writing competition. Can you find out the last line of the Haiku for one of my entries?

Flag Format = i_love_poems_a_lot

Hint1: Search up UT Dallas Haiku Competition 
Hint2: Find the entries for 2023 and search by my full name
