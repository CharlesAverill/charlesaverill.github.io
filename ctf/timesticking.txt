Title: Time's Ticking?

http://198.74.54.173:8080/

A suspicious person hosts a super-secure website with high-security hashed tokens to authenticate users. But we were able to secure the credentials of one of the users, Bob. 

Also: The admin is always running late, maybe the server's clock is broken?

Username: bob
Password: bob123

We need you to hack into the site with your l33t skills and access the admin panel so we can take this person DOWN.

Hints:
Look at the cookies
Use a hash identifier, Google: 'hash identifier'
